# Photo Sharing Application (Instagram Clone)

## Purpose

This will be a photo sharing app, similar to Instagram. User's will be able to sign up, create a profile. Once signed up, User's will be able to post pictures.
These picture's can be tagged with keys to later search through. People can then scroll through other people's pictures, like and comment on them. 

## Layout
**Sign-in/Create Page**

The first page will be a sign in page. The User will be prompted to enter a username/password which will lead to their profile if entered correctly.

If the User doesn't have an account and would like to create one instead. They will be able to with the create profile button.

This will take the User to a new page where they can create a profile name (this must be unique and will be the primary identifier for users), a profile picture to upload, a short description of themselves and some contact info (this will be private however to other users).

Below are the wireframes for both the mobile and desktop versions.

**Profile Page**

Once signed or profile is created, the user will be brought to the user's profile page. This will include their picture, name, short description at the top. Underneath will be a counter for all the posts they have made, The amount of profiles they follow as well as the amount that follows them. Underneath that will be a small version of all the pictures they have posted.

On the User's Profile page there will be a link to update/edit their profile however when viewing another profile (which will have the same format) that button will be replaced by a follow button.

The overall layout for the pages will have a navigation bar listing what page the user is on out of Profile, Feed, Browse, Notification and post. With the current pge being highlighted. This navigation bar will be at the bottom of the screen for mobile and at the top for desktop.

Wireframes are shown below.

On the edit page there will be an option to logout from the session which will lead to a page saying goodbye.

There will also be a delete profile option which the user can delete theyre profile. If clicked the user will be prompted to make sure this is what they want, if so the profile will be deleted and another page similar to the logout page will be shown with another goodbye message.
